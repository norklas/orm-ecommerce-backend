# E-commerce Back End Challenge

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation of the backend for an e-commerce site. It uses **Express.js** and **Sequelize** to interact with a MySQL database. It will perform RESTful CRUD operations with the routes provided. I built this project to become more familiar with **Sequelize** models, and their associations, as well as the creation of routes with **Express.js**. I learned how to properly set up **Sequelize** models, and create relationships between them. I've also become more familiar with the **MySQL** command prompt during the creation of this project.

## Installation

No installation required, simply clone the GitHub repository, and then follow the commands below!

## Usage

To use the schema, simply type the following command:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

You can seed the database with the following command:

```
npm run seed
```

Then you can start the server with the following command:

```
npm start
```

I've provided a walkthrough demonstrating CRUD for each model with Insomnia in this video, https://drive.google.com/file/d/10glfEmlLoCRfmyQPxtE8I3H0g_wfHzhw/view
